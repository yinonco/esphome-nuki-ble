# Nuki BLE Pairing Modes Examples

## App Mode (Recommended for Bridge Users)

```yaml
lock:
  - platform: nuki_ble
    device_name: "ESP32-Nuki"
    device_id: 12345678
    pin_code: "1234"
    pairing_mode: "app"  # Won't affect your Nuki Bridge
```

**Use this if**: You already have a Nuki Bridge and want to add ESP32 as an additional control method.

## Bridge Mode

```yaml
lock:
  - platform: nuki_ble
    device_name: "ESP32-Nuki"
    device_id: 12345678
    pin_code: "1234"
    pairing_mode: "bridge"  # Pairs as a bridge
```

**Use this if**: You want to replace your Nuki Bridge with ESP32.

## Fob Mode

```yaml
lock:
  - platform: nuki_ble
    device_name: "ESP32-Nuki"
    device_id: 12345678
    pin_code: "1234"
    pairing_mode: "fob"  # Pairs as a fob
```

**Use this if**: You want ESP32 to behave like a Nuki Fob.

## Important Notes

- **App mode is recommended** if you have an existing Nuki Bridge
- Each pairing mode has different capabilities and limitations
- You can have multiple devices paired in different modes simultaneously
- The ESP32 will appear as a separate device in your Nuki app when using app mode
